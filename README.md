# House Sale Price Prediciton - Neural Network (Pytorch)

This was Unviersity Coursework that has been preovously submitted and shows my learning as obviously much fo this can be improved.

A simple Neural Network made with pytorch to predict the sale price of properties in Melbourne from a variety of pieces of inforamtion about the house that provide information such as size and location.
The Dataset used is from Kaggle and can be found below:

This was one of the first Neural Networks I worked on and the results can be seen below:
